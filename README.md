    A C++ RAII PipeWire-API Wrapper
</p>

<hr/>

<div align="center">

### Description

<div align="left">

_Rohrkabel_ is a RAII wrapper around the pipewire-api that aims to simplify work with it, at the moment _Rohrkabel_ is only used by Soundux to reduce LOC and simplify the work with pipewire.  

**Currently only a portion of the pipewire-api is supported.**  

Depending on personal demand from Soundux or the community more portions of the API can be covered, simply open an issue if you'd like something to be added.
